title: How To Become a Better Web Developer
---

When it comes to web development, I want to learn it all. And by all, I mean *all the things* -- from server maintenance to design. And I want to become the best I can at all these things.

Since I started working at [NodeOne](http://nodeone.se) (now [Wunderkraut](http://wunderkraut.se) ) I have learned a ton of new stuff, but maybe more importantly come to a few realisations. These realisations are somewhat paradoxical: the first one was that it is quite impossible for me to learn all these things before I reach the age of 87, and by then the world will have moved on to... neon holograms in 3D space, or something. No one will care about by my Linux knowledge any more.

The second realisation was that even if I can't learn all of it, I can learn *enough to get by*. Working as we do at Wunderkraut, in small(-ish) teams where each team member has some form of specialised knowledge, but we all try our hand at everything, I will at least get to *experience* all of these things, and more things I hadn't even thought of myself. The only part I'm missing is the pre-study and design phase of projects, but I'm trying to sate that part of myself by doing a few mini-sites outside of work each year.

The third realisation was that the reason I want to learn everything, is that I don't want to be dependent on anyone else for solutions to my problems. Maybe this is a by-product of having built web sites all by myself for so many years, never having anyone to ask when things went awry. That is stressful when you have only yourself, and why I dislike not being able to manage on my own. It was incredibly frustrating in the beginning when my Drupal SKILLZ were decidedly not up to par and I constantly had to bother my team mates with the smallest things.

However, while I nowadays rarely have to ask them how to accomplish a certain feature because I can usually think of at least one way of doing it, I find myself still asking one or two or all of them. Working together, we get all the pros and cons of each proposed solution on the table, and we argue about it until we're all (more or less) confident we're choosing the right solution for the client and the project.

So while I've always wanted to learn ALL THE THINGS so that I could -- by myself -- build the best website for whatever client I was working with, I'm starting to realise that even if I knew more JavaScript, or more PHP or more whatever, my ultimate goal of building better sites would not be fully reached anyway. I would miss the process of hashing things out with someone else. Especially someone who doesn't hesitate to say that my solution is a bad solution. I need constructive criticism to be a happy web developer.
