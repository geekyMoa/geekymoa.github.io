title: Drupal vs WordPress
---

I have received a few quips about working with Drupal and yet using WordPress for my blog. To that I say, use whatever fits best for the project you're working on.

* Despite what any Drupalistas might say ;) , setting up a blog with WordPress is faster and easier than with Drupal. WordPress' famous simple install process is just that - stupidly simple and fast. 
But Drupal is pretty straightforward to install too, you might say, especially for someone who is working with Drupal and has installed Drupal a fair number of times by now. Yet, WordPress is still easier and faster.
* WordPress is a blog from the moment it is installed. No setting up content types and configuring image filters and installing a WYSIWYG editor of choice - it's all just there. Write and publish, bam!
* Sorry, Drupalistas, the amount of well-designed themes for WordPress is just infinitely larger. I think this is because of the many web designers who have discovered WordPress as an easy way to make websites for clients, i.e. the WordPress community has a larger amount of developers coming from the designer end of things than Drupal. This did not factor into my decision to use WordPress since I made my own theme. What *did* matter is that I can put together a WordPress theme in my sleep while theming a Drupal site still requires me to be at least somewhat capable of focusing.
* And finally, WordPress' back-end is just prettier. And I like pretty things.

Some day, I'm going to make a really pretty Drupal admin theme.
