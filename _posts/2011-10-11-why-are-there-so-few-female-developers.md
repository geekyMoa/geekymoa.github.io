title: Why are there so few female developers?
---

Currently I'm the only female developer at my office, and one of a total of four in the company (and two of the four are currently on leave). We had an interesting discussion over lunch about this that mostly dealt with experiences during childhood, even though it somehow degraded into space cowboys...

Anyway, thinking back to my own upbringing, we always had computers at home but my parents' neither encouraged or discouraged computer use. They were just there. I remember played Digger, a Pacman clone, on my dad's Toshiba laptop with DOS. When we got Windows 3.11 and a colour printer, I used to collect horse pedigrees and print them out with a pretty headline, and I liked changing the colours and layout of my Windows 3.11 desktop.

Then we got Windows 95 and the internet, and I think it was my dad who gave me *HTML4 for Dummies*, for some inexplicable reason. Like so many others I carefully hunt-and-pecked my first site in NotePad, and it was all about me. And horses. Probably mostly about horses.

And it was *lots of fun*!

My own empirical research into why my female friends and classmates don't pursue a career in development (web or software) shows that they tend to prefer designing. I understand that, I love designing and that's where I started, but part of why I got into the development was because I wanted to make my designs *work*. Not just be a static Photoshop file -- pretty, but useless -- but to be something that people could *use*.

I guess I have no answer to the question, but I find it strange that there seem to be so few women interested in such a creative and exciting line of work. It's just so much **fun**!
